The analyzed WECS is based on a PMSM connected through a non-controlled rectifier to the DC-bus. This paper proposes a new control strategy for improving the wind energy conversion efficiency based on the DC voltage regulation. In addition, in order to eliminate over-currents risk during unbalanced conditions, a control scheme has been designed to independently control positive and negative sequence currents. The proposed controller is based on the feedback linearization technique and shows an improvement in the system performance regarding 2\&amp;\#x03C9; ripple elimination in the DC voltage arising during AC-side imbalances and an accurate and decoupled active and reactive power tracking.},

abstract = {Wide-area analysis and control of large-scale electric power systems are highly dependent on the idea of aggregation. For example, one often hears power system operators mentioning how northern Washington oscillates against southern California in response to various disturbance events. The main question here is whether we can analytically construct dynamic electromechanical models for these conceptual, aggregated generators representing Washington and California, which in reality are some hypothetical combinations of thousands of actual generators. In this paper we address this problem, and present a concise overview of several new results on how to construct simplified interarea models of large power networks by using dynamic measurements available from phasor measurement units (PMUs) installed at specific points on the transmission line. Our examples of study are motivated by widely encountered power transfer paths in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), namely, a two-area radial system representing the WA-MT flow, and a star-connected three-area system resembling the Pacific AC Intertie.},

abstract = {The contribution of this paper is the application of subspace system identification techniques, to derive a low-order black-box state-space model of a power system with many controllable devices using global signals. This model is a multiinput, multioutput open system model describing the power oscillatory behavior of the power system. The input signals are the controllable setpoints of the controllable devices, the output signals are the speed of selected generators measured by a wide-area measurement system. This paper describes how to achieve and preprocess the data to use subspace techniques to estimate and validate to finally assign an accurate model. This new approach can be used directly to design a central coordinating controller for all of the relevant controllable devices, with the aim to increase the damping of the modes in the system. Previously presented methods use local measurements or output signals dependent on the actual operational point. The benefit of the presented method is that the used output signals are independent of the system state. This makes it possible to use state-feedback control to combine the controllable devices to coordinately damp the modes. The presented method is applied in the CIGREÌ Nordic 32-bus system including two HVDC links. The case study demonstrates that accurate low-order state-space models can be estimated and validated by using the described method to accurately model the system's power oscillatory behavior.},

abstract = {Future power systems face several challenges; one of them is the use of high power converters that decouple new energy sources from the AC power grid. This decreases the total system inertia affecting its ability to overcome system frequency's disturbances. The wind power industry has created a controller to enable inertial response on wind turbines generators: Artificial, Emulated, Simulated, or Synthetic Inertial. This paper deals with issues related to the synthetic inertia of wind turbines based on full-converters and their effect on the frequency protection/control schemes during the recovery period after system frequency disturbances happen. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate (based on simulations) the recovery period of under-frequency transients on future power systems which integrate wind turbines with synthetic inertia capability not completely avoid worse scenarios in terms of under-frequency load shedding. The extra power delivered from a wind turbine during frequency disturbances can substantially reduce the rate of change of frequency providing time for the active governors to respond. However, synthetic inertia might not completely avoid under-frequency load shedding.},

abstract = {In this research work, the design and implementation of a 154-kV Â± 50-Mvar transmission static synchronous compensator (T-STATCOM) have been carried out primarily for the purposes of reactive power compensation and terminal voltage regulation and secondarily for power system stability. The implemented T-STATCOM consists of five 10.5-kV Â±12-Mvar cascaded multilevel converter (CMC) modules operating in parallel. The power stage of each CMC is composed of five series-connected H-bridges (HBs) in each phase, thus resulting in 21-level line-to-line voltages. Due to modularity and flexibility of implemented HBs, each CMC module has reached a power density of 250 kvar/m3, thus making the mobility of the system implementable. DC-link capacitor voltages of HBs are perfectly balanced by means of the modified selective swapping algorithm proposed. The field tests carried out at full load in the 154-kV transformer substation where T-STATCOM is installed have shown that the steady-state and transient responses of the system are quite satisfactory.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple method of evaluating the first swing stability of a large power system in the presence of various flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. First a unified power flow controller (UPFC) and the associated transmission line are considered and represented by an equivalent pi-circuit model. The above model is then carefully interfaced to the power network to obtain the system reduced admittance matrix which is needed to generate the machine swing curves. The above pi-circuit model can also be used to represent other FACTS devices (SSSC and STATCOM) by selecting appropriate values of control parameters of the UPFC. The complex voltage at two end buses of the pi-circuit model is also evaluated during simulation to implement various existing control strategies of FACTS devices and to update the reduced admittance matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed method of generating dynamic response and hence evaluating first swing stability of a power system in the presence of various FACTS devices is tested on the ten-machine New England system and the 20-machine IEEE test system. The results obtained with various FACTS devices are also compared and discussed.},

abstract = {Recently, renewable wind energy is enjoying a rapid growth globally to become an important green electricity source to replace polluting and exhausting fossil fuel. However, with wind being an uncontrollable resource and the nature of distributed wind induction generators, integrating a large-scale wind-farm into a power system poses challenges, particularly in a weak power system. In the paper, the impact of static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) to facilitate the integration of a large wind farm (WF) into a weak power system is studied. First, an actual weak power system with two nearby large WFs is introduced. Based on the field SCADA data analysis, the power quality issues are highlighted and a centralized STATCOM is proposed to solve them, particularly the short-term (seconds to minutes) voltage fluctuations. Second, a model of the system, WF, and STATCOM for steady state and dynamic impact study is presented, and the model is validated by comparing with the actual field data. Using simulated PV and QV curves, voltage control and stability issues are analyzed, and the size and location of STATCOM are assessed. Finally, a STATCOM control strategy for voltage fluctuation suppression is presented and dynamic simulations verify the performance of proposed STATCOM and its control strategy.},

Subspace methods such as Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) and Numerical algorithms for Subspace State Space System Identification (N4SID) algorithms are well known and often implemented especially for multivariable identification due to the use of robust numerical tools such as the QR decomposition and singular value decomposition (SVD). SMI algorithms are attractive not only because of their numerical stability and simplicity, but also for the state space form that is very suitable in estimating, predicting, filtering and control design. Several simulation studies for MOESP and N4SID algorithms performed in online version are presented. This paper focuses on computation time, order selection and the stability from both methods when performed online.},

This paper presents studies on a model identification approach with the use of synchronous measurement data to represent an equivalent system. Firstly, in the study, the coherent generators in each area of large EPS are determined by the mutual information theory. Then, state-space two-input two-output models are identified for a single generator representing the coherent area. The model identification algorithms; least-square (LS), instrumental variable (IV) and subspace state-space (N4SID) based generalized Poisson moment function (GPMF) are used. Finally, the controller is designed with the identified model at WAMS level by reducing the Hâ norm of its closed loop transfer function as much as possible. The centralized controller at WAMS level is demonstrated to stabilize the speed deviations of each generator between any two areas in the large EPS. The study is investigated with different input signal variable excited by different pattern of under disturbances.},

abstract = {Several studies on transient stability analysis of power systems with hybrid Multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) have been conducted, but very few have focused on small signal stability and designing oscillation damping controller. As a hybrid MTDC system has its distinctive characteristics due to interaction between Line Commutated Converter (LCC) and Voltage Source Converter (VSC) converters, with nearby wind farm, SVCs and other electronic equipment, impacts of its components on the electromechanical modes of the system need to be investigated thoroughly. In this paper, the Simplified Southern Eastern (SE) Australian system has been modified and extended to explore network stability impacts of the hybrid MTDC links. System identification is implemented to determine the linearized model and the electromechanical oscillations of the power system.},

abstract = {A voltage source converter based HVDC (HVDC-VSC) transmission system is considered in this paper. This technology is one of the most promising FACTS in future power systems. A 7-th order non-linear averaged model is chosen for the HVDC-VSC, suitable for transient stability analysis and control design. Its behavior is validated against a more realistic EMTDC-PSCAD model in an open-loop test. After that, an L<sub>g</sub>V controller is developed based on the model obtained. The controller is applied to the EMTDC model and its capability to track set-points related with active power, reactive power and other suitable variables is tested. The performance of the proposed controller shows better results than PI controllers proposed in earlier papers, having better stability margin and shorter time response},

abstract = {A two-level hierarchical structure is proposed to improve the stability of multimachine power systems. The solution consists of a local controller for each generator at the first level helped by a multivariable central one at the secondary level. The secondary-level controller uses remote signals from all generators to synthesize decoupling control signals that improve the local controllers' performances. The first-level controllers, on the other hand, use only local signals to dampen local oscillations. A systematic procedure for the design of the wide-area signals based central controller is given. It is based on a reformulation of the multimachine power system model into a suitable and closed form. Our control strategy leads to a robust wide-area controller having two major components: a model-based decoupling nonlinear control and an adaptation module. The nonlinear control parameters are updated so that the controller sensitivity to power systems operating point and structure variation is considerably reduced. The hierarchical structure is used on a large power system and simulation results reveal that the system stability is considerably improved: a power system, unstable under conventional controllers (AVR-PSS/GOVERNOR), is rendered stable when combining the central and local controllers' actions.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the design of effective input signals for low-level probing of power systems. In 2005, 2006, and 2008 the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) conducted four large-scale system-wide tests of the western interconnected power system where probing signals were injected by modulating the control signal at the Celilo end of the Pacific DC intertie. A major objective of these tests is the accurate estimation of the inter-area electromechanical modes. A key aspect of any such test is the design of an effective probing signal that leads to measured outputs rich in information about the modes. This paper specifically studies low-level probing signal design for power-system identification. The paper describes the design methodology and the advantages of this new probing signal which was successfully applied during these tests. This probing input is a multi-sine signal with its frequency content focused in the range of the inter-area modes. The period of the signal is over 2 min providing high-frequency resolution. Up to 15 cycles of the signal are injected resulting in a processing gain of 15. The resulting system response is studied in the time and frequency domains. Because of the new probing signal characteristics, these results show significant improvement in the output SNR compared to previous tests.},

abstract = {This paper presents the stability-improvement results of four parallel-operated offshore wind turbine generators (WTGs) connected to an onshore power system using a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). The operating characteristics of each of the four WTGs are simulated by a 5-MW wind permanent-magnet synchronous generator while the onshore power system is simulated by a synchronous generator (SG) fed to an infinite bus through two parallel transmission lines. A damping controller of the proposed STATCOM is designed by using a pole-assignment approach to render adequate damping to the dominant modes of the studied SG. A frequency-domain approach based on a linearized system model using eigenvalue analysis is performed while a time-domain scheme based on a nonlinear system model subject to disturbances is also carried out. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the proposed STATCOM joined with the designed damping controller can effectively improve the stability of the studied SG-based onshore power system under various disturbance conditions.},

abstract = {Centralized control using system-wide data has been suggested to enhance the dynamic performance of large interconnected power systems. Because of the distance involved in wide-area interconnections, communication delay cannot be ignored. Long time delay may be detrimental to system stability and may degrade system performance. The time delay tolerance of a centralized controller and the associated performance tradeoff is analyzed using a small gain criterion. Special attention is paid to the choice of weighting functions in a robust control design. As expected, it is found that time delay tolerance decreases when the system bandwidth increases, while the nominal system time-domain performance is concomitantly improved. Several approaches which can maintain a good system performance while increasing the time delay tolerance are suggested and compared. A modern controller design technique, like gain scheduling via linear matrix inequalities, is evaluated for the design of the supervisory power system stabilizer accounting for various time delays.},

abstract = {With significant investment made in the U.S. in deploying synchrophasor measurement technology, more wide-area measurements will be available and controls based on these signals are likely to be adopted. Communication systems play a critical role in interactive grid control as an indispensable medium to transmit wide-area measurements; however, they are vulnerable to disruptions leading to the risk of destabilizing power systems. This work addresses a critical issue related to engineering resilient cyber-physical systems. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical set of wide-area measurements for control and employs channel switching based on mathematical morphology identification to counteract the impact of communication failures on control effectiveness. The proposed control framework incorporating a set of synchronized wide-area measurements is designed to consist of multiple single-input single-output supplementary damping controllers associated with a static VAr compensator. This work is particularly important with regard to leveraging the large investment in installing phasor measurement units across the nation.},

abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that wide-area signals obtained using synchronized phasor measurements could be more effective than local signals in damping inter-area oscillations in large interconnected systems. To transmit wide-area signals for use in controls, communication systems are required. Communication systems are vulnerable to disruptions as a result of which the reliability of the power system could be jeopardized. In order to counteract communication failures, resiliency could be built in either the communication system or the physical system. In this paper an approach is developed to build resiliency in grid controls in the physical system. The resiliency is achieved by robustly designing a novel redundant two-input single-output (TISO) supplementary damping controller (SDC) associated with a static VAr compensator (SVC) that utilizes both a wide-area signal and a local signal to guarantee that the system is stabilized if the wide-area signal is lost. Numerical tests on the IEEE 50-generator test system have demonstrated that the proposed SDC is effective in stabilizing the system and improving grid control resiliency in response to communication failures.},

abstract = {In this work a hierarchical scheme is proposed for the coordinated control of conventional synchronous generators, wind farm converters and flexible ac transmission systems. It comprises two levels, namely a fully decentralized set of controllers associated with the involved devices and a centralized coordinating controller based on synchronized wide-area signals provided by phasor measurement units. The proposed hierarchy of controllers is mainly focused on two objectives: transient frequency support and inter-area oscillations damping. Several works have recently proved that the fast-acting power converters of variable-speed generators can greatly improve the short-term frequency regulation capability in scenarios with a large penetration of wind energy. A case study is included showing that the dynamic performance and stability of power systems can indeed be enhanced when windmill converters are properly coordinated via a wide-area centralized controller.},

abstract = {A control strategy is proposed to enhance the operation, under network disturbances, of a wind turbine driven doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The scheme allows us to overcome low voltages, imbalances, and harmonic distortions at the point of common coupling. The control law is designed using a feedback linearization approach plus resonant filters; this law directly controls the DFIG stator powers from the rotor voltages, unlike the most used nested two-loop approaches. An accurate control of the active and reactive powers delivered to the grid permits us to fulfill severe grid code requirements and to improve the fault ride-through capability. Under unbalanced conditions, the reference currents of both grid- and rotor-side converters are coordinately chosen to simultaneously eliminate the double-frequency pulsations in the total active power and electromagnetic torque. Several tests and disturbances to provide a realistic assessment and validation have been performed, showing the adequacy of the proposed controller. Comparisons with other control approaches with different objectives are also presented to illustrate the advantages regarding elimination of the double-frequency ripples and harmonic rejection capability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method to enhance the participation of variable-speed wind energy conversion systems (WECS) in existing frequency regulation mechanisms. The proposed approach, based on a modified inertial control scheme, takes advantage of the fast response capability associated with electronically-controlled WECS, allowing the kinetic energy stored by rotational masses to be partly and transiently released in order to provide earlier frequency support. An additional improvement is achieved by communicating the WECS response to conventional generators so that these can eventually take care of the full load imbalance. Several simulations using a two-area test system are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {Nowadays the control of medium voltage motors has two main alternatives for its development: voltage source inverters (VSI); or current source inverters (CSI). The cascaded multilevel inverters derive from high voltage, high power quality and high reliability requirements in both development alternatives. Up to now, the cascaded multilevel converters have been implemented using voltage source power cells. However, they can also be implemented using current source units. One factor against CSIs is the large size of the inductive filters needed in the DC links, especially when single-phase inverters are considered. This paper presents a current-source cascaded multilevel converter (CS-CMC), based on single-phase power cells and their implementation alternatives, which enable a reduction in the sizes of the DC-link inductors. It is demonstrated that these sizes can be reduced using magnetic couplings between the DC links of the power cells. These magnetic couplings can eliminate second harmonic currents, as well as other even harmonics of current in the DC link of the power cells. This work asserts that the implementation of a current-source cascaded multilevel converter, based on single-phase power cells, must consider magnetic couplings between its DC links. Design results and the simulation of a development alternative of the system, aim to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the cascaded multilevel converter.},

abstract = {The increasing penetration of distributed power generation into the power system leads to a continuous evolution of grid interconnection requirements. In particular, active power control will play an important role both during grid faults (low-voltage ride-through capability and controlled current injection) and in normal conditions (reserve function and frequency regulation). The aim of this paper is to propose a flexible active power control based on a fast current controller and a reconfigurable reference current selector. Several strategies to select the current reference are studied and compared using experimental results that are obtained during an unsymmetrical voltage fault. The results of the analysis allow selection of the best reference current in every condition. The proposed methods facilitate multiple choices for fault ride through by simply changing the reference selection criteria.},

@book{Milano2010,
abstract = {Power system modelling and scripting is a quite general and ambitious title. Of course, to embrace all existing aspects of power system modelling would lead to an encyclopedia and would be likely an impossible task. Thus, the book focuses on a subset of power system models based on the following assumptions: (i) devices are modelled as a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations, (ii) all alternate-current devices are operating in three-phase balanced fundamental frequency, and (iii) the time frame of the dynamics of interest ranges from tenths to tens of seconds. These assumptions basically restrict the analysis to transient stability phenomena and generator controls. The modelling step is not self-sufficient. Mathematical models have to be translated into computer programming code in order to be analyzed, understood  and âexperiencedâ. It is an object of the book to provide a general framework for a power system analysis software tool and hints for filling up this framework with versatile programming code. This book is for all students and researchers that are looking for a quick reference on power system models or need some guidelines for starting the challenging adventure of writing their own code.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a real-time oscillation monitoring system for detecting the emergence of small-signal instability related events in large electric power systems. The oscillation monitoring system has been developed as a fully autonomous expert system for real-time extraction of modal information from the wide-area PMU measurements during the progress of power system disturbance events. The oscillation analysis uses three different algorithms, namely, the classical multiple-input Prony algorithm, the matrix Pencil algorithm as well as the recent Hankel total least square method. These algorithms were primarily used for off-line manual analysis of power system oscillations in the past. In our research, a specific set of rules has been designed to automate the modal analysis of oscillations by using the three algorithms above without any human intervention during the analysis. The monitor will thus issue operator alerts or control triggers whenever the damping levels of the electromechanical modes of oscillation go below preset thresholds.},

abstract = {In this paper, static synchronous compensator (STATCOM)-based damping stabilizers are designed and implemented to enhance the damping of the low frequency oscillations. The effectiveness of STATCOM gain and phase modulation channels to improve the damping characteristics is investigated. The coordination among the internal ac and dc voltage controllers and the proposed damping controllers on each channel is designed. Differential evolution as an intelligent optimization technique is considered to design the STATCOM supplementary damping controllers. The STATCOM-based stabilizer is implemented on a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). The RTDS experimental setup of STATCOM with a power system is verified. The nonlinear time domain simulation of the considered power system is presented to validate the proposed damping stabilizers of low frequency oscillations. Comparisons with the reported results in the literature demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilizer.},

The IEEE first benchmark model on SSR is adopted with integrating aggregated self-excited induction generator-based wind turbine to perform the studies. The potential occurrence and mitigation of the SSR caused by induction generator effects as well as torsional interactions, in a series compensated wind park, are investigated. The auxiliary subsynchronous damping control loop for the STATCOM based on a novel design procedure of nonlinear optimization is developed to meet the damping torque in the range of critical torsional frequencies. The intelligent shaft monitor (ISM) scheme with synthesized special indicator signals is developed and examined in the STATCOM control structure. The performances of the controllers are tested in steady-state operation and in response to system contingencies, taking into account the impact of SCRs. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the controllers for mitigating the SSR, damping the power system oscillation, and enhancing the transient stability margin in response to different SCRs.},

abstract = {Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) and Numerical algorithms for Subspace State Space System Identification (N4SID) algorithms are two well known subspace identification techniques discussed in this paper. Due to the use of robust numerical tools such as QR decomposition and singular value decomposition (SVD), these identification techniques are often implemented for multivariable systems. Subspace identification algorithms are attractive since the state space form is highly suitable to estimate, predict, filters as well as for control design. In literature, there are several simulation studies for MOESP and N4SID algorithms performed in offline and online mode. In this paper, order selection, validity and the stability for both algorithms for model identification of a glass tube manufacturing process system is considered. The weighting factor $\alpha$, used in online identification is obtained from trial and error and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Utilizing PSO, the value of $\alpha$ is determined in the online identification and a more accurate result with lower computation time is obtained.},

abstract = {Wind power generation studies of slow phenomena using a detailed model can be difficult to perform with a conventional offline simulation program. Due to the computational power and high-speed input and output, a real-time simulator is capable of conducting repetitive simulations of wind profiles in a short time with detailed models of critical components and allows testing of prototype controllers through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL). This paper discusses methods to overcome the challenges of real-time simulation of wind systems, characterized by their complexity and high-frequency switching. A hybrid flow-battery supercapacitor energy storage system (ESS), coupled in a wind turbine generator to smooth wind power, is studied by real-time HIL simulation. The prototype controller is embedded in one real-time simulator, while the rest of the system is implemented in another independent simulator. The simulation results of the detailed wind system model show that the hybrid ESS has a lower battery cost, higher battery longevity, and improved overall efficiency over its reference ESS.},

abstract = {The electric spring is an emerging technology proven to be effective in i) stabilizing smart grid with substantial penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources and ii) enabling load demand to follow power generation. The subtle change from output voltage control to input voltage control of a reactive power controller offers the electric spring new features suitable for future smart grid applications. In this project, the effects of such subtle control change are highlighted, and the use of the electric springs in reducing energy storage requirements in power grid is theoretically proven and practically demonstrated in an experimental setup of a 90 kVA power grid. Unlike traditional Statcom and Static Var Compensation technologies, the electric spring offers not only reactive power compensation but also automatic power variation in non-critical loads. Such an advantageous feature enables non-critical loads with embedded electric springs to be adaptive to future power grid. Consequently, the load demand can follow power generation, and the energy buffer and therefore energy storage requirements can be reduced.},

abstract = {Using wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) offers a possibility for an integrated measurement-based and model-based control, which suits to the operation of large electric power system (EPS), along with online analysis. This study presents studies on fixed-order controller design through model identification approach with use of synchronous measurement data. Firstly, in the study, the coherent generator in each area of large EPS is determined by the mutual information theory. Then, state-space two-input two-output model is identified for the generator that has highest participation factor and thus referred as coherent generator. The model identification algorithms; least-square, instrumental variable and subspace state-space based generalised Poisson moment function are used. Next, WAMS level model is identified between the input controllable variable and speed deviation difference of coherent generator of each area. Finally, a local controller (decentralised) in each coherent area and a centralised controller at WAMS level between two coherent areas are designed by optimisation of the several design functions; Hâ norm, H2 norm, spectral abscissa and complex stability radius, as much as possible. These controllers feed supplementary control signal in addition to one fed by local conventionally tuned power system stabiliser. The centralised controller at WAMS level is demonstrated to stabilise the speed deviations of each generator between any two areas in the large EPS. The study is investigated with different input signal variables; $\Delta$Vref, $\Delta$Pm excited by different pattern of disturbances.},

abstract = {This paper describes three models developed through the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) SVC Task Force, to represent static Var systems (SVS) for power-flow and time-domain stability simulations. The goal was to develop a set of model structures that are generic, and can be easily parameterized to represent a variety of SVS systems. The term generic is used to imply a model structure that is not specific to a given vendor or equipment, and that is non-proprietary and public. These models have been implemented by several software vendors, and may soon be adopted by others. These models offer: 1) a suitable non-proprietary, not vendor specific set of models that can be used to evaluate SVS solution options for planning studies, and 2) the means to move away from the proliferation of user-written models that are becoming hard to manage in large interconnected power system models such as the WECC. The dissemination of the models and modeling documentation helps provide guidance to power system planners and operators about the latest SVS technologies and their application.},

abstract = {The high penetration of distributed generation, as PV or wind power, has forced the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to set restrictive requirements for the operation of such systems. As it can be extracted from the forthcoming grid codes drafts, the future distributed generation systems will be requested to have the equivalent performance of a synchronous generator, which is seen from the TSOs as the only solution if a massive integration of renewable in the electrical network should be achieved. In this paper a method for controlling PV grid connected power converters as a synchronous generator, namely Synchronous Power Controller (SPC), is presented. As a difference with previous works this method permits to take advantage of emulating the synchronous behavior meanwhile it is able to get rid of its drawbacks. The main concept of the SPC, as well as some simulation and experimental results will be shown in this paper considering a PV power plant as a study case.},

abstract = {This paper presents a control scheme based on a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) to achieve both voltage control and damping enhancement of a grid-connected integrated 80-MW offshore wind farm (OWF) and 40-MW marine-current farm (MCF). The performance of the studied OWF is simulated by an equivalent doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) driven by an equivalent wind turbine (WT) while an equivalent squirrel-cage rotor induction generator (SCIG) driven by an equivalent marine-current turbine (MCT) is employed to simulate the characteristics of the MCF. A damping controller of the STATCOM is designed by using modal control theory to contribute effective damping characteristics to the studied system under different operating conditions. A frequency-domain approach based on a linearized system model using eigenvalue techniques and a time-domain scheme based on a nonlinear system model subject to various disturbances are both employed to simulate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. It can be concluded from the simulated results that the proposed STATCOM joined with the designed damping controller is very effective to stabilize the studied system under disturbance conditions. The voltage fluctuations of the AC bus subject to the active-power variations of the studied system can also be effectively controlled by the proposed control scheme.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors use the Numerical algorithm for Subspace State Space System IDentification (N4SID) to extract dynamic parameters from phasor measurements collected on the western North American Power Grid. The data were obtained during tests on June 7, 2000, and they represent wide area response to several kinds of probing signals, including low-level pseudo-random noise (LLPRN) and single-mode square wave (SMSW) injected at the Celilo terminal of the Pacific HVDC Intertie (PDCI). An identified model is validated using a cross validation method. Also, the obtained electromechanical modes are compared with the results from Prony analysis of a ringdown and with signal analysis of ambient data measured under similar operating conditions. The consistent results show that methods in this class can be highly effective, even when the probing signal is small},

abstract = {In large interconnected electric power systems, inter-area electromechanical oscillations may occur due to weak links among power systems. These oscillations involve power exchanges but also voltage and current oscillations that may cause tripping of lines or generators and thus lead to severe disturbances. Such oscillations have been (rarely) observed in the synchronous interconnected system of Continental Europe (former UCTE) being characterized by very low frequency (down to 0.2 Hz). This paper presents the inter-area oscillation modes observed along the last years in the European System and the activities undertaken so far for their sufficient monitoring and damping. It also presents the impact of the future connection of the Turkish power system to the Continental Europe power system.},

Comprising a dual-ported transformer circuit topology with the attractive characteristics common to the advanced induction electric machine system, such as versatility, robustness, field weakening, practically unconstrained torque and power rating, simplicity, and low cost, etc., but with higher efficiency and torque than the permanent magnet electric machine system, the fully electromagnetic core of the BWRSDF uses readily available technology and materials without the market volatility, safety and reliability issues of rare-earth permanent magnets.},

The developed techniques are based on models identified in real-time from measured data. The resulting models yield the actual power system dynamics. They can be used for monitoring purposes as well as for design of stabilizing/damping controllers applied to any fast acting power electronic devices installed in power systems such as HVDC, FACTS devices or excitation systems of synchronous generators. The described monitoring algorithms have already been implemented using existing hardware and productized. This makes it possible to show some results and practical experience collected in cooperation with several transmission system operators.},

abstract = {In this paper the problem of voltage security is studied under the system operator's (SO) point of view, who should take the correct actions to avoid voltage collapse phenomena. The aim of the SO is to decide which parameters, among those under his control, to use to enlarge the loading margin of the system and, consequently, move the collapse point away from the current operation point. To do so, an heuristic tool based on a particular OPF and a sensitivity analysis is presented, moreover, the different strategies that the SO could take are explained. The optimization model used to compute the loading margin to voltage collapse gives, as an additional information, the loading margin sensitivities with respect to some typical control parameters in different loading situations. The processing of this information is presented in this paper.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to demonstrate the advantages of using more dynamic information (like internal dynamics) to perform the load-frequency control, instead of using an input-output approach, as is usual in the current Automatic Generation Control (AGC) structures. This is done using an optimal state feedback centralized control strategy based on state space models of generators and the power system. An observer is used to estimate power load and non measured states. The new power market structure is taken into account, using hourly energy blocks as generator's references. Finally, several simulation cases are presented to show the results obtained with this new approach.},

abstract = {This paper proposed an approach to combining the recently developed FACTS and WAMS technologies to damp inter-area low-frequency oscillations and enhance transfer capability of interconnected power systems. The approach includes three steps: Firstly we use PRBS probing technique and N4SID to obtain a reduced-order model of the studied system. Then wide-area measurements are employed as feedback signals and an optimal damping control loop is designed via LQR approach for the FACTS controller in a multi-machine environment. Finally with communication delays of WAMS considered, a least square prediction algorithm is developed to derive instant feedback quantities, and thus make the proposed control practicable in real systems. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, case study is fulfilled using a two-area four-machine power system with STATCOM, one of the most promising FACTS controllers, connected to the inter-area transmission. Extensive digital simulation results demonstrate its validity in damping inter-area power oscillation and enhancing transfer capability along long-distance tie lines.},

abstract = {The usage of remote signals obtained from a wide-area measurement system (WAMS) introduces time delays to a wide-area damping controller (WADC), which would degrade system damping and even cause system instability. The time-delay margin is defined as the maximum time delay under which a closed-loop system can remain stable. In this paper, the delay margin is introduced as an additional performance index for the synthesis of classical WADCs for flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices to damp inter-area oscillations. The proposed approach includes three parts: a geometric measure approach for selecting feedback remote signals, a residue method for designing phase-compensation parameters, and a Lyapunov stability criterion and linear matrix inequalities (LMI) for calculating the delay margin and determining the gain of the WADC based on a tradeoff between damping performance and delay margin. Three case studies are undertaken based on a four-machine two-area power system for demonstrating the design principle of the proposed approach, a New England ten-machine 39-bus power system and a 16-machine 68-bus power system for verifying the feasibility on larger and more complex power systems. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on providing a balance between the delay margin and the damping performance.},
